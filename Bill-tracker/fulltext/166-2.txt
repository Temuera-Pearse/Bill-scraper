Building and Construction (Small Stand-alone Dwellings) Amendment Bill

Government Bill

166—2

As reported from the Transport and Infrastructure Committee

Commentary
Recommendation

The Transport and Infrastructure Committee has examined the Building and Construction (Small Stand-alone Dwellings) Amendment Bill and recommends that it be passed. We recommend all amendments unanimously.

Introduction

This bill is intended to reduce the time and cost of building stand-alone dwellings that are 70 square metres or less. It would do this by amending the Building Act 2004 to permit such dwellings (often referred to as “granny flats”) to be constructed without a building consent if certain conditions were met. The conditions are that:

the dwelling is simple in design and would comply with the building code

building work would be carried out by authorised professionals

councils were notified prior to, and on completion of, building work.

The policy behind this bill was in the coalition agreement between the National Party and New Zealand First: “amend the Building Act and the Resource Consent system to make it easier to build granny flats or other small structures up to 60sqm.” We understand that the Government decided to increase this to 70 square metres following public consultation in 2024. We are aware that corresponding changes for resource consenting under the Resource Management Act 1991 are being done through proposed National Environment Standards for Granny Flats. This is expected to take effect by the end of 2025.

Legislative scrutiny

As part of our consideration of the bill, we have examined its consistency with principles of legislative quality. We have no issues regarding the legislation’s design to bring to the attention of the House.

Proposed amendments

This commentary covers the main amendments we recommend to the bill as introduced. We do not discuss all minor or technical amendments.

Interpretation

We propose including some additional definitions in clause 4, amending section 7 (interpretation), to improve the workability of the bill. We recommend inserting:

“final design plans”, referring to the final drawings and specifications to which a small stand-alone dwelling is constructed

“preliminary design plans”, referring to the preliminary design drawings (including a site plan, elevations, and basic sections) to which a small stand-alone dwelling is proposed to be constructed.

We consider that defining these terms will provide certainty around what information should be included and produced when design plans are required.

We also propose inserting a definition of “non-consented small stand-alone dwelling” into other relevant legislation. We recommend inserting:

clause 33A, amending section 2(1) of the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987

clause 51A, amending regulation 4(1) of the Electricity (Safety) Regulations 2010

clause 54A, amending regulation 3(1) of the Gas (Safety and Measurement) Regulations 2010.

Project information memoranda

Sections 31 to 39 of the Act set out provisions regarding project information memoranda. Memoranda are issued by territorial authorities, and provide information held by an authority that may affect a proposed building project. The information could include details of any existing stormwater or wastewater utility systems that relate to the proposed building work, potential issues with erosion, slippage, or flooding, or the heritage status of an existing building nearby.

Requirements for a project information memorandum

Clause 15, proposed new section 42B, specifies that no building work on a non-consented small stand-alone dwelling could begin before a project information memorandum had been issued under section 34 of the Act. Clause 6 of the bill as introduced would amend section 32 of the Act to allow an owner to apply for a memorandum if they were considering carrying out building work in connection with a non-consented small stand-alone dwelling.

Some submitters commented on an inconsistency between these two clauses. We heard that, under new section 42B, no work could begin before a memorandum was issued, but amended section 32 states that a homeowner “may” apply for a memorandum. We think that clause 15 does require a homeowner to obtain a memorandum before beginning construction; however, we consider that this could be made clearer in the bill. We recommend amending clause 6 to insert new subsection (2) into section 32 to make clear that no building work could begin on a small stand-alone dwelling before a project information memorandum had been issued.

Project information memorandum only required for final site

We consider that the bill as introduced is not sufficiently clear about whether a project information memorandum would be required if the construction of a small stand-alone dwelling occurred in a different location than the final site of that small stand-alone dwelling (for example, if a dwelling is constructed in a factory and then transported to the final site). We consider that a memorandum would only be relevant for the small stand-alone dwelling’s final location, and that it would be unnecessary to obtain one for the offsite location where it was built and transported from. We therefore recommend amending section 34 (through clause 8 of the bill) to clarify that if a memorandum was issued for the final site of a dwelling, no additional memoranda would be required if the dwelling was constructed in a different location.

Information to be provided in project information memorandum

We consider that some information not typically provided in a project information memorandum may be relevant where a non-consented small stand-alone dwelling is being built. Clause 11 of the bill proposes new section 35A, which sets out additional information that must be supplied in such cases.

We recommend several amendments to the list of information territorial authorities are required to provide. We think our amendments would ensure that homeowners have all the information necessary to inform their construction of small stand-alone dwellings. Our amendments:

clarify that territorial authorities should be able to indicate in the memorandum if it is unclear whether the proposed land for construction was likely to be subject to natural hazards (subsection (2)﻿(b)﻿(i))

clarify that territorial authorities should be able to indicate if it is unclear whether the construction of a small stand-alone dwelling was likely to accelerate, worsen, or result in a natural hazard on that land (subsection (2)﻿(b)﻿(ii))

would provide (in subsection (2)﻿(c)) that, if a territorial authority found that there were or were likely to be issues raised under subsections (2)﻿(b)﻿(i) and (ii), the authority would make a statement that a building consent may be required or that preliminary design plans may need to be amended

insert subsection (3), allowing the territorial authority to include any additional information not outlined in section 35A that it considered relevant (including relevant information in district and regional plans).

Information to be kept by territorial authorities

Section 216 of the Act requires territorial authorities to keep information about buildings to enable members of the public to be informed of their obligations and participate effectively under the Act. Subsection (2) specifies the information that must be kept.

Clause 20 of the bill as introduced would insert new paragraph (ba) into subsection (2). Paragraph (ba) sets out that a territorial authority must keep all information it has received in relation to a non-consented small stand-alone dwelling, and lists what this may include. We consider that additional information provided through proposed section 35A should also be kept (under section 216). We therefore recommend amending paragraph (ba) to include the additional information provided under section 35A as information that must be kept by territorial authorities.

Implied warranties

Section 362I of the Act provides a list of implied warranties for building work. Subsection (1)﻿(a)﻿(ii) states that part of the contract is that the building work will be carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications set out in the contract.

Plans and specifications are required as part of the building consenting process. As the bill would allow for non-consented small stand-alone dwellings, this language would not apply. We therefore recommend inserting new clause 21A, which would amend section 362I to provide that, in relation to a non-consented small stand-alone dwelling, building work would have to be carried out in accordance with the final design plans.

Liability protections

Section 392 of the Act sets out that no civil proceedings may be brought against a building consent authority for any of the matters listed in subsection (1). For consistency, as the regime in this bill does not involve building consent authorities, clause 22 of the bill proposes to insert new section 392A. The new section provides a good faith liability protection, stating that no civil proceedings could be brought against a territorial authority for anything related to information provided through section 35A.

Under amendments to section 216 proposed through clause 20 of the bill, territorial authorities would have to store information provided to them in relation to a dwelling. Clause 15, new section 42B(4), would require owners of non-consented small stand-alone dwellings to provide records of work, final design plans, and certificates of work, among other things, to territorial authorities within 20 working days of the completion of building work.

We heard from councils who raised concerns that they could be liable in relation to information that they would have to store, but had not assessed in relation to the construction of the dwelling. We note those concerns and recommend amending new section 392A (through clause 22) to insert good-faith liability protections in relation to information provided under section 42B(4).

Requirements for small stand-alone dwellings

Schedule 1 of the Act describes building work for which a building consent is not required. The bill proposes inserting new Schedule 1A into the Act. This would set out the characteristics and requirements of building work related to small stand-alone dwellings for which building consents are not required.

Non-consented building work is still subject to other legislation

Clause 15 would insert sections 42B and 42C into the Act. Section 42B sets out conditions for building work for which building consent would not be required under Schedule 1A. We recommend inserting subsection (7) into section 42B to clarify that, despite not requiring a building consent, specified building work would still be subject to requirements under other legislation (or documents under that legislation), unless the context otherwise requires. For example, the New Zealand Code of Practice for Safe Electrical Distances would still apply unless the context specified otherwise.

Proposed amendments to building work requirements

Clause 2 of proposed Schedule 1A of the Act sets out the requirements for small stand-alone dwellings. We recommend amending clause 2 to clarify that non-consented dwellings could not contain a mezzanine floor. Mezzanine floors are often higher-risk work. Also, constructing one would mean that a building would not align with the requirement in clause 1 of Schedule 1A (that a small stand-alone dwelling has a single storey only).

We considered whether the two subclauses relating to building height and foundation height in new Schedule 1A clause 2(1)﻿(b) and (c) could be merged for simplicity, and to provide more flexibility in housing design. We received advice that this may introduce more complex foundation and roofing designs, creating higher risk. While we have no changes to recommend at this time, we consider that as trades evolve and competencies increase these provisions could be revisited. We note that the requirements in clause 2 can be changed by Order in Council. We encourage the Minister to monitor whether these provisions need to be adjusted in future, following their real-world application.

Resource consents and network utility connections

We note that, despite not requiring a building consent, a homeowner might still need to apply for a resource consent for certain matters, such as earthworks or works related to plumbing and drainage.

We consider that it is very important for people to properly understand that some resource consents may still be required despite not needing a building consent for the building itself. We are advised that requirements for resource consents are set out in local authorities’ district and regional plans.

Our proposed amendment to clause 11 of the bill (new section 35A(3)) would set out that territorial authorities may include additional information in project information memoranda that they believed was relevant, such as any applicable requirements set out in district and regional plans. When applying for a project information memorandum, a homeowner would have to indicate if they intend to seek approval to connect to network utility operator systems. A network utility operator (or territorial authority acting as one) can place conditions on the connection to a network utility operator system, such as specifying the specific tradespeople who must carry out the connection. No changes are proposed to this current approach.

A network utility operator has discretion on the requirements that must be met and the conditions that can be placed on someone who wishes to connect to its network. However, these must be based on existing powers set in legislation other than the Building Act (such as the Health Act 1956 or the Water Services Act 2021). For example, a network utility operator may require devices for backflow prevention to be installed, to protect network infrastructure and public health against the risk of backflow into a reticulated drinking water supply. This could be at the point of supply, or on the property or allotment itself. Some councils or operators publish these requirements and policies on their websites.

Under G12 of the Building Code, housing is considered low risk, and therefore is exempt from the requirements of backflow prevention/containment backflow prevention specified under G12/AS1 3.0 Protection of potable water. This also extends to premises that only contain household units.

While we understand the importance of making sure that people are not able to connect to networks without the proper authority and recommend no changes at this time, we also want to ensure this provision ensures network utility operators do not set conditions that would allow them to access and make changes to and within the structure of the dwelling itself.

Proposed amendments to network utility connections

In the bill as introduced, clause 2(1)﻿(h) of new Schedule 1A would require the water supply, sanitary plumbing, and drainage of a small stand-alone dwelling to be “simple” and designed and built in accordance with specified acceptable solutions for compliance with the building code. We consider that these requirements could be made much clearer, as “simple” is too subjective. We therefore recommend inserting new subclause (1A) into clause 2 of the Schedule, which lists specific requirements for water supply, sanitary plumbing, and drainage systems.

Clause 2(1)﻿(h)﻿(ii) states that water supply, sanitary plumbing, and drainage would have to connect to network utility operator services if available, and otherwise to on-site systems.

We recommend three major amendments, along with some minor wording changes, to improve workability of these provisions. These are to:

insert new paragraph (ha) into subclause (1) to require any on-site system to be designed and built in accordance with any applicable acceptable solution set out in subsection (1)﻿(h)﻿(i), and verification methods E1/VM1 and G13/VM4 (if applicable)

insert new subclause (1B) to clarify that connection to a network utility operator system or an on-site system, or building work in connection with an on-site system, would not require a building consent

insert new clause 3 into the Schedule which sets out definitions including:

“not available”, in relation to a network utility operator system, meaning that there is not a system sufficiently close to the dwelling, or that a system that is sufficiently close does not have enough capacity

“on-site system”, meaning a system for the independent management of stormwater, wastewater, or water supply that does not connect to a network utility operator system.

Our proposed clause 3 would also define all acceptable solutions and verification methods referred to in the Schedule.

the building work is carried out on land that is not subject to a natural hazard (as advised by the relevant territorial authority), or, where a natural hazard (within the meaning of section 71(3)) is present or is likely to be present on the relevant land or construction of the dwelling is likely to accelerate, worsen, or result in a natural hazard on the land or any other property, building work is not carried out unless adequate provision has been made to protect the land, building work, or other property from the natural hazard:

(e)

the small stand-alone dwelling is not constructed over a boundary on land that comprises or partly comprises 2 or more allotments of 1 or more existing subdivisions (whether comprised in the same record of title or not).
