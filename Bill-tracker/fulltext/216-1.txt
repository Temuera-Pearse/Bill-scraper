Social Media (Age-Restricted Users) Bill

Member’s Bill

216—1

Explanatory note
General policy statement

This Bill seeks to protect young New Zealanders from the harms of social media by regulating access for individuals under the age of 16. The policy aims to:

reduce the risks to young people of cyberbullying, harmful content, and online exploitation

safeguard young users’ privacy from commercial exploitation and data breaches

encourage healthier social interactions and offline activities.

There are signs that social media use can have a negative impact on young people.

The Bill mandates that social media platforms implement strict age verification measures to prevent under-16s from creating accounts. It introduces regulatory oversight to ensure compliance and penalise non-compliant platforms. Additionally, it promotes digital literacy and public awareness programs to educate parents and children on safe online behaviour.

This approach is essential given the increasing negative impacts of social media on young users. Aligning with international efforts, including Australia’s recent policy shift, the Bill provides a proactive, enforceable solution to safeguard children while fostering a safer digital environment.
