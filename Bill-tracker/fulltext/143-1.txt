Life Jackets for Children and Young Persons Bill

Explanatory note
General policy statement

New Zealand has a high fatal drowning rate compared to other Western nations. For the last decade, the drowning rate has been 1.7 per 100,000 of population and in 2020 is 1.62. Far greater than Australia’s 1.1 and Canada’s 1.3 per 100,000. Analysis from Water Safety New Zealand shows that in the 161 boating fatalities between 2011 and 2020, life jackets were carried but not worn in 40 and unavailable in 59.

Life jacket wearing rates have increased markedly in recent years. However, many boat users still do not wear life jackets regularly. Consequently, fatalities that could have been avoided on our waters continue to occur. Analysis of boating accidents shows that capsizes and other events are often unexpected, and boat users have little or no opportunity to put on their life jackets. To reduce the risk for children and young persons under 15 years, it is necessary to make fundamental changes to rules 91.2 to 91.4 of the Maritime Rules, which govern the circumstances in which life jackets must be worn on recreational craft.

This Bill provides that recreational craft of 6 metres or less cannot be used unless every person on board under the age of 15 years wears a life jacket. This is a significant departure from the existing regime, which largely leaves the wearing of life jackets to the skipper’s discretion and those on board. The current exceptions in the Maritime Rules - for surfboards, sailboards, and windsurfers provided a wet suit is worn, supervised water sports events, and commercial rafting - are all preserved. The amendment applies everywhere in New Zealand waters, regardless of local navigation bylaws.

The term “personal flotation device” is replaced by the more contemporary term “life jacket”. Consultation draft Ensuring no loophole for craft with hulls less than 6 metres in length To ensure that the amendment applies to craft that are, in reality, 6 metres or less in length, waterline length is to be used in place of overall length. This means that bowsprits, prods, and similar appendages associated with small craft, which do not increase seaworthiness in the same way as additional hull size, cannot be used as a loophole. The extra length provided by an outboard motor does not count for the same reason.
