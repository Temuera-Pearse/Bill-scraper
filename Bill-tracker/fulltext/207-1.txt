Animal Welfare (Regulations for Management of Pigs) Amendment Bill

Government Bill

207—1

Explanatory note
General policy statement
Legislative framework for pig welfare in New Zealand has 3 key elements

The Animal Welfare Act 1999 (the Act) requires owners and people in charge of animals to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the physical, health, and behavioural needs of the animals are met according to good practice and scientific knowledge.

The Animal Welfare (Care and Procedures) Regulations 2018 include requirements for shelter, minimum lying space, farrowing, and other management matters relating to pigs.

The Code of Welfare: Pigs 2018 (the Pigs’ Code) includes minimum standards and recommended best practices for the management of pigs.

High Court judgment—Animal Welfare (Care and Procedures) Regulations 2018 and minimum standards 10 and 11 of Pigs’ Code

On 13 November 2020, in New Zealand Animal Law Association v Attorney-General [2020] NZHC 3009, the High Court of New Zealand ruled that regulation 26 (relating to farrowing crates) and regulation 27 (relating to mating stalls), and the associated minimum standards in the Pigs’ Code, were unlawful and invalid.

In response, on 14 December 2020, the Cabinet agreed to new regulations, with a phase-out period, that allowed the continued use of current farrowing crate and mating stall systems by the pork industry for 5 years, until 18 December 2025. The Cabinet’s intent at that time was that new regulations that complied with the Act would come into effect by 18 December 2025. This transition period was designed to give the sector time to shift towards compliant systems and allow the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC) time to review the Pigs’ Code and associated regulations.

NAWAC reviewed and consulted on changes to the Pigs’ Code and the associated regulations to align pig welfare standards with the Act, including farrowing systems.

Across the submissions from the pork industry, suggestions for the transition period ranged from 10 to 25 years due to the scale of changes required to comply with NAWAC’s proposals.

Section 183A of the Act allows for a single transition period of up to 10 years for the regulations relating to farrowing requirements and other requirements relating to management of pigs (including the use of mating stalls), with a possible 5-year extension. However, this option was exercised when the Cabinet set the current 5-year transition period in 2020. As a result, extending the transition period further by regulation is not possible.

To extend the current transition period for farrowing crates and mating stalls to allow farmers more time to meet the new requirements, the regulations must be made through an amendment to the Act.

Objective of this Bill

The objective of this Bill is to support a legally compliant and welfare-focused transition for New Zealand pig farmers beyond the current expiry date for regulations 26 and 27 of the Animal Welfare (Care and Procedures) Regulations 2018 of 18 December 2025. The new regulations will ensure that locally produced pork products meet good animal welfare practices whilst providing the industry with certainty and maintaining productivity for the sector.

The Bill extends the transition period of the current regulations related to farrowing crates and mating stalls to 18 December 2035, providing farmers sufficient time to transition to the new requirements. If these regulations are not extended before the current expiry date, they will be revoked, meaning that farmers who continue to use current farrowing crates and mating stalls practices may be vulnerable to court action.

The Bill inserts new versions of the following regulations:

regulation 25 (minimum lying space for grower pigs) to increase the minimum space requirement by 13.3% via an increase in the k value1 from 0.03 to 0.034:

regulation 26 (farrowing requirements) to—

require sows in any farrowing system to be provided with manipulable and deformable materials; and

decrease the maximum period sows may be kept in farrowing crates from a total of 33 days to a maximum of 3 days prior to farrowing and a maximum of 4 days post-farrowing; and

decrease the maximum period nursing sows may be kept in farrowing crates from 1 week to 36 hours; and

require records to be kept on compliance with these requirements:

regulation 27 (other requirements relating to management of pigs) to—

reduce the time sows may be confined in mating stalls from 7 days per reproductive cycle to 3 hours at a time; and

require that, after a pig has been released from a mating stall, the pig is not again confined in stalls for a period of at least 3 hours.

Clause by clause analysis

Clause 1 is the Title clause.

Clause 2 states that the Bill comes into force on the day after Royal assent.

Clause 3 states that the Bill amends the Animal Welfare Act 1999 (the principal Act).

Part 1
Amendments to Animal Welfare Act 1999

Clause 4 inserts new section 71(5). The new subsection relates to section 71(1)﻿(b), which requires NAWAC to be satisfied that a draft code of welfare complies with the purposes of the principal Act before the draft is publicly notified under section 71. New section 71(5) provides that section 71(1)﻿(b) must be treated as being met in relation to proposed standards and recommendations in a draft code if NAWAC is satisfied that they are needed to give effect to, or for consistency with, any of regulations 25 to 27 of the Animal Welfare (Care and Procedures) Regulations 2018 (the care and procedures regulations). Those regulations set out requirements for the minimum lying space for grower pigs, farrowing, and other matters relating to the management of pigs.

Clause 5 inserts new section 73(7), which relates to section 73(1)﻿(a). Section 73(1)﻿(a) requires NAWAC to be satisfied that the standards proposed in a draft code of welfare are the minimum necessary to ensure that the purposes of the principal Act will be met. New section 73(7) provides that section 73(1)﻿(a) must be treated as being met in relation to proposed standards if NAWAC is satisfied that they are needed to give effect to, or for consistency with, any of regulations 25 to 27 of the care and procedures regulations.

Clause 6 amends section 75, which provides for the Minister to issue a code of welfare that is recommended by NAWAC. It also provides for the Minister to refer the code back to NAWAC or to decline to issue the code. Clause 6 inserts new section 75(4A) and (4B) so that—

standards and recommendations in a code of welfare issued under section 75 must be treated as complying with the purposes of the principal Act if the Minister is satisfied that they are needed to give effect to, or for consistency with, any of regulations 25 to 27 of the care and procedures regulations:

recommendations in a report prepared by NAWAC after a code is referred back to it by the Minister must be treated as complying with the purposes of the principal Act if NAWAC is satisfied that they are needed to give effect to, or for consistency with, any of those regulations.

Clause 7 amends section 183A, which empowers the making of regulations relating to standards of care. Under section 183A(6), the period for which regulations prescribing standards or requirements that do not fully meet key obligations under the principal Act are in force may be extended for a limited time. Clause 7 inserts a reference to new section 204(2), which disapplies section 183A(6) in relation to regulations 26 and 27 of the care and procedures regulations.

Clause 8 inserts new sections 203 to 205.

New section 203 confirms that—

regulation 25 of the care and procedures regulations is, and has always been, validly made under section 183A(1):

regulations 26 and 27 of the care and procedures regulations are, and have always been, validly made under section 183A(2).

New section 204 provides for the extension of regulations 26 and 27 of the care and procedures regulations, which would otherwise be revoked on 18 December 2025. Under new section 204, those regulations and regulation 25 of the care and procedures regulations are revoked on the close of 18 December 2035 (unless sooner replaced or revoked).

New section 205 repeals, on 19 December 2035, the provisions that the Bill inserts into the principal Act.

Clause 9 and Schedule 1 insert new Part 3 into Schedule 4 to provide for transitional matters. New Part 3 provides for the situation where the process of preparing a code of welfare in relation to pigs is underway when the Bill comes into force. To the extent that sections 71(1)﻿(b), 73(1)﻿(a), and new section 75(4B) are relevant, new Part 3 treats those sections as being met or as applying in relation to standards or recommendations in the code that the Minister is satisfied are needed to give effect to, or for consistency with, any of regulations 25 to 27 of the care and procedures regulations.

Part 2
Related amendments to Animal Welfare (Care and Procedures) Regulations 2018

Clause 10 states that Part 2 amends the care and procedures regulations.

Clause 11 amends regulation 2 to bring new regulation 65 into force on 19 December 2035. New regulation 65 inserts the new regulations 25 to 27 set out in Schedule 2 into the care and procedure regulations. The new regulations will be inserted immediately after regulations 25 to 27 are revoked by new section 204 of the principal Act.

The new regulations 25 to 27 that come into force on 19 December 2035—

increase the spacing requirement for grower pigs:

require sows in farrowing systems to be provided with material that can be both manipulated and deformed until farrowing, rather than requiring only that manipulable material be provided:

impose that requirement in relation to all farrowing systems, rather than only those constructed after 3 December 2010:

decrease the maximum period that sows may be kept in farrowing crates before farrowing from 5 days to 3 days:

decrease the maximum period that sows may be kept in farrowing crates for lactation after farrowing from 4 weeks to 4 days:

decrease the maximum period that nurse sows may be kept in farrowing crates for fostering purposes from 1 week to 36 hours:

clarify that the period for which a nurse sow may be kept in a farrowing crate for fostering purposes may occur at any time after the sow is kept in a farrowing crate for lactation after farrowing, rather than needing to follow on immediately after that initial period:

require records to be kept documenting compliance with the farrowing requirements:

reduce the maximum period that sows may be kept in mating stalls from 7 days per reproductive cycle to 3 hours, with a period of at least 3 hours before they may be returned to mating stalls.

Clause 12 inserts into regulation 25 a reference to the provisions that insert new regulation 25 on 19 December 2035.

Clauses 13 and 14 amend regulations 26 and 27 to replace the provisions that revoke those regulations on 18 December 2025 with provisions that are similar to the one inserted into regulation 25 by clause 12.

Clause 15 inserts new regulation 65 as described in relation to clause 11.

Clause 16 and Schedule 2 insert new Schedule 3, which sets out the new regulations 25 to 27 described in relation to clause 11.
