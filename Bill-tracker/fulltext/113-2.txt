Land Transport Management (Time of Use Charging) Amendment Bill

Government Bill

113—2

As reported from the Transport and Infrastructure Committee

Commentary
Recommendation

The Transport and Infrastructure Committee has examined the Land Transport Management (Time of Use Charging) Amendment Bill and recommends that it be passed. We recommend all amendments unanimously.

Introduction

The bill would amend the Land Transport Management Act 2003 to establish an enabling framework for time of use charging schemes.

A time of use charging scheme is a method of managing traffic flow in certain high-traffic areas by charging motor vehicles when travelling through those areas at certain times. The charges will vary by vehicle type and location, and may vary depending on the day and the time of day. The purpose of such schemes would be to improve traffic flow, and thereby improve the productivity of the road network.

The bill’s framework would set out:

processes for local authorities to initiate and propose time of use charging schemes, for public consultation and assessment before submission for approval by the Minister of Transport and establishment by Order in Council

the creation of scheme boards, which would be made up of representatives of local authorities and the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA), to develop and implement the scheme

mechanisms for a scheme board to adjust charges, manage scheme operations, and reinvest revenue into local transport improvements

provisions for NZTA to collect and bill charges

oversight arrangements for schemes once implemented.

Legislative scrutiny

As part of our consideration of the bill, we have examined its consistency with principles of legislative quality. We have no issues regarding the legislation’s design to bring to the attention of the House.

Proposed amendments

This commentary covers the main amendments we recommend to the bill as introduced. We do not discuss minor or technical amendments.

Most of the amendments discussed below would amend clause 4. Clause 4 would insert new subpart 3 (sections 65A to 65ZH) into Part 2 of the principal Act, setting up the provisions for time of use charging schemes.

Scheme boards

Scheme boards would be established under section 65U(2), with responsibility for a time of use charging scheme. We recommend several amendments relating to the bill’s scheme board provisions, as discussed below.

Membership of scheme board

In the bill as introduced, proposed new section 65V(1) specifies that scheme boards must have no more than six board members. Of these, up to five must be representatives of the local authorities that have joined the scheme, including:

up to three representatives of the local authority or authorities that initiated the scheme

one additional representative for each other local authority that joins the scheme.

If more than three local authorities have joined the scheme, the five representatives must be appointed by agreement of all the local authority members of the scheme. The board must also include at least one representative of NZTA.

We consider that by capping the total board membership at six, local authorities in regions with many authorities might not have direct representation on the board. We recommend amending proposed section 65V(1) to remove the cap on board membership, which would allow each local authority scheme member to appoint their own representative to the board.

We also consider that initiating local authorities’ right to have up to three representatives on the board should be reduced to a minimum of one representative when there are more than six board members. This would mean that all local authority scheme members would have a direct representative, without the board’s membership growing to an unwieldy number. To achieve this, we recommend amending section 65V(1) so that the scheme board must consist of:

one representative of each local authority that is a member of the scheme

one additional representative of each local authority that initiated the scheme, if less than three local authorities are members of the scheme

up to two representatives of NZTA.

Local authorities to approve certain decisions

Proposed section 65V(4) states that the chairperson of the scheme board must be a representative of NZTA. Subsection (5) states that the chairperson holds the casting vote.

We heard concerns from local authorities that they would have no control over schemes once a scheme board is established, as NZTA would hold the casting vote. This could mean that local authority scheme board representatives could be overruled if they disapproved of the proposed terms of the scheme.

We consider that a better balance could be achieved, to allow local authorities more influence over schemes that will be used to manage local congestion. We are concerned that some local authorities might decide not to initiate schemes if they considered they would not have enough influence over them.

We therefore recommend inserting new section 65ZAC, which would require some decisions of the board to be ratified by a majority of local authority members of the scheme. For the purposes of this section, each local authority would be entitled to one vote, despite the balance of voting rights set out in section 65V. The decisions subject to this would be:

submitting a scheme proposal to the Minister

submitting a proposal to the Minister to vary a scheme

submitting a request to the Minister to terminate a scheme

disestablishing a scheme board before a proposal is submitted to the Minister.

We also recommend consequential amendments elsewhere in the bill to achieve these purposes (sections 65V(6) and 65ZAB).

We also consider that an independent chairperson would mitigate these concerns. We discuss this further below.

Independent chairperson

Many submissions from local authorities raised issues with the balance of the governance model set out in the bill, where an NZTA representative would be the chairperson of the scheme board and have the casting vote. While we have responded to this in our recommendation above, we also considered alternative ways to address these concerns. As part of our consideration, we discussed the benefits of an independent board chair with a casting vote.

We therefore recommend replacing proposed section 65V(4), which sets out that the chairperson must be a representative from NZTA. Our recommended replacement would include replacing subsection (4) with new subsections (4) to (4C). These would state that the chairperson of the scheme board must be independent and appointed unanimously by NZTA and the local authorities that initiated the scheme. Subsection (4B) would require that a representative from NZTA would remain the chairperson if the scheme was initiated by NZTA, and local authorities had chosen not to be involved. If there were one or more local authorities who chose to be involved, they would have the right to an independent chair. Subsection (4C) would require that remuneration for an independent chairperson must be determined by the responsible Minister in accordance with the fees framework defined in section 10 of the Crown Entities Act 2004.

If NZTA was not in the majority, we consider that scheme boards might be able to impose large and unjustified costs or commitments on NZTA’s billing and collection functions (provided through section 65ZG). We therefore consider that any amendments to the bill to provide for an independent chair would need to mitigate this risk. We recommend that this be done by inserting paragraph (cb) into new section 65W, which would require that any decisions relating to NZTA’s responsibilities for collecting charges and conducting billing could only be made with NZTA’s agreement.

Legal status of scheme boards

The Law Society raised issues around the legal status of scheme boards. We agree that the bill could be amended to make the legal status of these boards clearer.

First, we recommend inserting subsection (1A) into proposed section 65U, to clarify that scheme boards would not be separate legal entities (such as a Crown entity or body corporate). This would state that a scheme board “is a body that directs members of a time of use charging scheme on matters relating to the proposal for, and development, operation, and enforcement of, that scheme.”

We also recommend inserting new section 65WA to make it clear that, while a scheme board is not a legal entity, information held by the board would be subject to the requirements under the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. These provisions would apply as far as they are applicable, and “with the necessary modifications”.

We also recommend a number of minor amendments to strengthen provisions around the legal status of scheme boards. They would:

clarify, in section 65W(c) that the board would direct the operation of the scheme, rather than operating it itself

amend section 65O to reflect that NZTA—not the scheme board—would be responsible for billing and collection, and therefore responsible for issuing notices that a charge is unpaid

insert new subsection (aa) into section 65ZG(1), stating that NZTA would be the default secretariat support for a scheme board, and responsible for providing secretariat services, unless the scheme board determined otherwise

insert new subsection (ab) into section 65W to provide that a scheme board has the ability to determine that a member of the scheme must provide secretariat services for the scheme board, despite section 65ZG.

Privacy provisions

The bill as introduced would allow NZTA and the enforcement authorities (as defined in section 65A) to collect personal information for the purposes of collecting time of use charges, such as information linked to registration plates. Several submitters expressed concern about the use of camera technology, and how long enforcement authorities could keep personal data.

We consider that privacy of personal information is a very serious subject, and recommend several amendments to enhance the privacy provisions in the bill. These are:

inserting new paragraph (fa) into section 65Z(2) to require that the scheme’s impact assessment must set out the potential impacts on privacy brought about by the scheme, and any measures likely to be needed to address those impacts

clarifying, in section 65ZF(4), that NZTA and the enforcement authority must each have a privacy policy that sets out its approach to collecting personal information

inserting new subsection (4A) into section 65ZF to require that the enforcement authority and NZTA must consult with the Privacy Commissioner in developing their privacy policies.

Investment approach

We understand that the aim of this bill is to reduce congestion and improve network productivity. The bill as introduced would require that any revenue gained from potential schemes first be put towards operating costs, and any remaining revenue would then be reinvested into local transport improvements. The bill would require that net revenue is invested in accordance with an investment agreement between the Minister and the local authority members of the scheme. This would be agreed to before a scheme was operational. All provisions related to scheme revenue are set out in section 65S.

We consider that the provisions in new section 65S could be made stronger, to better reflect how revenue is intended to be used. We therefore recommend removing subsection (2), and amending subsection (1) to state that revenue from a scheme must be used to meet reasonable establishment and operational costs of a scheme, and that any net revenue may be disbursed by NZTA to land transport activities in the scheme region in a way that “contributes to an effective, efficient, and safe land transport system in the public interest.”

While we consider that this amendment makes clearer the obligations for how revenue should be spent, we are still concerned that the flexibility in the bill to use scheme revenue on a range of land transport activities might be too broad. We consider that any net revenue should be spent on activities that improve the ability of people to move around the area affected by the scheme. We accept that some flexibility would be needed to ensure that revenue can be spent on useful activities not directly tied to the scheme.

Proposed section 65X sets out the terms of investment agreements that local authority members of the scheme must reach with the responsible Minister before a scheme begins operations. To achieve the purposes outlined above, we recommend that section 65X(3) be amended to state that an investment agreement must prioritise land transport activities that “improve the ability of people to move into, out of, within, and around the scheme area.”

Exemptions within schemes

Clause 65P of the bill as introduced specifies that emergency vehicles would not be subject to time of use charges. It does not provide exemptions for any other vehicle types or categories of road user.

We consider that the definition of an emergency vehicle could be narrowed, to better align with the definition under section 52(6) of the principal Act. We therefore recommend amending section 65P(2) to remove civil defence and defence force emergency vehicles from the definition of emergency vehicle. This is consistent with the definition of emergency vehicles for tolling purposes.

Possible exemptions for public transport

During our consideration of this bill, we discussed whether further exemptions should be made, particularly for public transport. Many submitters raised concerns over exemptions. Some considered that exemptions should remain tightly limited, while others argued that some exemptions would not undermine a scheme’s overall effectiveness.

We note that time of use charging schemes are intended to improve traffic flow by changing when and how people travel. We consider that some road users who need to travel at peak times may switch to public transport as a rational response to time of use charges, and that exempting public transport from schemes could further incentivise people to use this instead of their own vehicles.

Rather than providing a blanket exemption for public transport vehicles in the bill, we suggest that this could be something for each individual scheme board to consider.

We therefore recommend amending section 65H to insert new subsection (2A). This would allow the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Minister, to include exemptions for large passenger service vehicles:

used primarily to provide public transport services in the time of use scheme area and identified as integral under a regional public transport plan

contracted or funded by the Ministry of Education for the sole or primary purpose of transporting school children to and from school.

We understand from our advisers that the vehicles provided by the Ministry of Education are primarily rural buses, and that there are not many of these. Nevertheless, we consider it important that these are able to be exempted.

We recommend consequential amendments to section 65D to require any exemptions for public transport to be included in a scheme proposal. We also recommend amending section 65P(1) to state that large passenger service vehicles exempted by Order in Council would also not be liable to pay a time of use charge.

We note that our amendments would not require these large passenger vehicles to be exempt under all schemes, but would allow the scheme board the mechanisms to do so. If a board did want to exempt these vehicles, it would have to be included in its scheme proposal and receive consultation from the public and the Minister.

Overall, we consider that exemptions should be limited strictly to those explicitly stated in legislation, and not be able to be made more broadly than the specific provisions Parliament chooses to enact. This reflects our view that exemptions must remain narrowly defined to protect the integrity and effectiveness of the charging framework.

Scheme impact assessment consideration of Māori views

Section 65Z(2) states that the scheme impact assessment must set out and explain specified information. Subsection (2)﻿(f) states that the impact assessment must include “the view of Māori in the scheme region on the impacts of the scheme on their interests.”

Some of us struggle to understand the relevance and practicality of this particular subsection.

We have been advised that this is consistent with wording in the principal Act. We are aware that the Act will be subject to upcoming wider reviews of treaty clauses in legislation. Some of us consider that this matter could be dealt with at that stage. We note that we did not receive any submissions on this particular issue.

Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand differing view

The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand has long had policy to investigate congestion pricing, and is supportive of giving road controlling authorities (RCAs) and territorial authorities (TAs) the ability to better manage existing infrastructure. While we are supportive of the overall goal of this legislation, we have some concerns and see some lost opportunities.

Low emission zones

When the Transport and Infrastructure Committee in the 53rd Parliament was conducting an inquiry into congestion pricing, it heard from many expert submitters that it should design legislation to allow for low emissions zones, which have worked very well overseas. Congestion is just one negative impact of our car-dependent transport system, and the cost of congestion is not as high as the negative cost of health impacts from air pollution, for example, or carbon emissions. Air pollution from motor vehicles was found to have directly caused approximately $10 billion in social costs each year, including 13,000 cases of childhood asthma prevalence (HAPINZ, 2016). Low emission zones have had a measurable impact on health outcomes where used in other jurisdictions (Luk Bruyneel et al, 2025). Low emissions zones are an additional tool TAs and RCAs should have available to them to get better outcomes in our urban areas.

Local representation and decision making

While the committee did move to introduce an independent chair, we still see some issues with the scheme boards giving disproportionate weight to Waka Kotahi New Zealand Transport Agency (Waka Kotahi) representing central government. This becomes particularly problematic if multiple TAs choose to join a scheme board, reducing representation for the TA(s) initiating the scheme. In regions like Wellington where there are many very small TAs, this could have a perverse effect of giving significantly more power on whether a scheme is adopted, how it is designed, and what any revenue is used for, to a small percentage of the population that resides far from where the scheme is physically located. We would prefer to see more representation on the scheme board from the TAs that directly contain the charging area, and the public transport authority. It is likely the majority of trips affected by a congestion pricing scheme will be local trips, and we believe the TA and public transport authority are the best placed to make effective decisions about when and where to put a scheme in, and what to best use the revenue on.

Use of revenue

When congestion pricing schemes have been put in place overseas, most of the surplus revenue has gone into additional public transport services, reducing fares, or improving active transport. A particularly notable case of this is in Stockholm. Congestion pricing revenue was initially used to pay for road improvements in and around the city, but are now used to fund new public transport infrastructure—and the same requirements apply now in Gothenburg (James, 2022). The vast majority of revenue in London has been used for public transport improvements (Greater London Authority, 2018), and New York City has exclusively funded public transport projects (Zanger, 2025). Requiring revenue to be spent on public and active transport infrastructure and services should be an explicit requirement of scheme revenue, once the costs of operation are covered. Further investment in infrastructure projects that increase or maintain car-dependency by induced demand will mean the time of use scheme will not be as effective in actually reducing congestion; public and active transport infrastructure projects routinely reduce congestion in the immediate and long-term.
