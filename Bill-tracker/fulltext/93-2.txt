Crimes (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill

Government Bill

93—2

As reported from the Justice Committee

Commentary
Recommendation

The Justice Committee has examined the Crimes (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill and recommends by majority that it be passed. We recommend all amendments by majority.

Introduction

The Crimes (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill would amend the Crimes Act 1961. It would strengthen the law to better prevent and respond to foreign interference intended to harm New Zealand. Foreign interference involves a foreign state, either directly or indirectly, attempting to interfere with New Zealand’s interests in a secretive, coercive, or dishonest way. Foreign interference may affect national security, the economy, elections, or individuals and communities.1

The bill would introduce new offences related to foreign interference into the Crimes Act. It would be an offence if a person:

engages in covert, deceptive, coercive, or corruptive conduct for, or on behalf of, a foreign power, to intentionally compromise a protected New Zealand interest, or is reckless as to whether the conduct is likely to compromise such an interest

commits an imprisonable offence to intentionally benefit a foreign power, or is reckless as to whether committing the offence is likely to provide such benefit.

The bill would require the Attorney-General to consent before proceedings can be brought for these offences.

The bill would also introduce new offences to address gaps in the criminal liability for espionage, treason, and inciting to mutiny. It would make it an offence for a person who owes allegiance to New Zealand’s Sovereign to assist another person to do, or not do, a relevant act, when certain conditions are met. The bill would also modify and extend existing offences related to espionage and wrongful communication, retention, or copying of information held by certain public agencies.

Legislative scrutiny

As part of our consideration of the bill, we have examined its consistency with principles of legislative quality. We have no issues regarding the legislation’s design to bring to the attention of the House.

Proposed amendments

This commentary covers the main amendments we recommend to the bill as introduced. We do not discuss minor or technical amendments.

Owing allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand

Clause 4 would insert new section 2A into the Crimes Act. Section 2 of the Act provides definitions for how terms used in the Act should be interpreted. Proposed new section 2A would introduce a definition for a “person who owes allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand”. This definition would only apply for the purposes of interpreting a small number of offences in the Crimes Act. It would not be an exhaustive definition. We propose several changes to this clause to make the definition, and its legal status, clearer. We discuss these recommendations below.

Clarifying the effect of dual or multiple citizenship on owing allegiance

Proposed new section 2A sets out circumstances in which a person would owe allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand. As introduced, new section 2A does not make clear how holding dual or multiple citizenship would affect whether a person owes allegiance to the Sovereign.

The policy intent is that a person outside New Zealand would owe allegiance to the Sovereign if they were a New Zealand citizen or have taken the oath of allegiance. This would be regardless of whether they are also a citizen of, or have taken an oath of allegiance to, another country. We recommend amending new section 2A(4) to make this clear.

Replacing the term “enemy alien”

Proposed new section 2A includes reference to the term “enemy alien”. It sets out circumstances in which a person would not be considered to owe allegiance to the Sovereign if they were an “enemy alien”. Neither the Act nor the proposed section includes a definition for this term.

We note that while the term “enemy alien” has been used in other Acts, it is not explicit what is meant by this reference.2 We consider that the language should be clearer. This would make the definition of when a person who owes allegiance to the Sovereign easier to interpret. We recommend replacing the term “enemy alien” with the term “citizen of a State that is at war with New Zealand” throughout new section 2A.

Making it a question of law whether a person owes allegiance

One submitter, the New Zealand Law Society, suggested that whether a person owes allegiance to the Sovereign should be made a question of law. A question of law is an issue that must be assessed by a judge. It is distinct from a matter of fact, which is determined by a jury.

In its submission, The New Zealand Law Society expressed the view that it would be more appropriate for a judge to decide whether a defendant owes allegiance to New Zealand, rather than a jury. The Law Society considers that this would support more consistent decision-making. We agree that this matter should be made a question of law. We recommend including subsections (4A) and (4B) in new section 2A accordingly.

Amendments to offence provisions

Clause 10 would insert new sections 78AAA and 78AAB into the Act to create new offences related to foreign interference.

New section 78AAA would make it an offence to engage in covert, deceptive, coercive, or corruptive conduct for or on behalf of a foreign power. The offender must either have intended to compromise a protected New Zealand interest or been reckless as to whether the conduct was likely to compromise such an interest.

New section 78AAB would make it an offence to commit any imprisonable offence intending to, or being reckless as to whether the offending is likely to, provide a relevant benefit to a foreign power.

We recommend several changes to these proposed new sections, to improve their clarity or to better reflect the bill’s policy intent. We discuss these recommendations below.

Safeguards for protests, advocacy, and industrial action

Some submitters expressed concerns that the proposed offences in new sections 78AAA and 78AAB might risk undermining fundamental rights, including the right to peaceful protest. We note that the wording of the new offences is purposely broad. The offences are intended to cover a wide range of foreign interference activity that has been identified internationally. However, we consider that the bill should make clear that engaging in protest, advocacy, or industrial action would not, by itself, be criminalised under new sections 78AAA and 78AAB. We recommend inserting new sections 78AAA(4A)﻿(b) and 78AAB(4A) to specify this, to avoid any doubt.

Amending the definition of “improper conduct”

Proposed new section 78AAA(6) includes definitions for certain terms used in the section. It defines “improper conduct” as conduct that is of a covert, deceptive, coercive, or corruptive nature. Under this section, conduct that is of a covert nature would include concealing a person’s identity or actions, obscuring an association or relationship, or collecting or sharing information about a person without consent. It would exclude any conduct lawfully carried out in the ordinary course of a business, profession, or occupation (for example, protecting journalists’ sources).

Some submitters were concerned that the definition of “improper conduct” might capture some activity that is routinely and lawfully carried out. For example, submitters mentioned that it was unclear how lawful conduct carried out as part of an unpaid position would be treated. Submitters also pointed out that many digital communications platforms have some form of encryption, and wondered whether use of these platforms would fall within the definition.

We consider that the definition of “improper conduct” should be clearer. We recommend amending proposed section 78AAA(6) accordingly. We also recommend inserting new section 78AAA(4A)﻿(a) to specify that it would not, in itself, be improper conduct to protect information in the ordinary course of a paid or unpaid business, profession, or occupation. We recommend inserting new section 78AAA(4B) to provide examples of what activity this could include, such as protecting trade secrets or commercially sensitive information, including by using encrypted communications.

Clarifying the scope of committing an imprisonable offence to benefit a foreign power

Under new section 78AAB, the proposed offence would only apply if a person committed an imprisonable offence with the intention of benefitting a foreign power, or was reckless as to whether committing the offence is likely to provide such benefit. Some submitters expressed concern that the wording of this proposed offence is too broad and might inadvertently criminalise conduct that it is not intended to.

We recommend amending proposed section 78AAB so that the offence would only apply if a person committed an imprisonable offence “for or on behalf of a foreign power”. We also recommend inserting new section 78AAB(4B) to define this. It would be defined as including committing an imprisonable offence:

at the instigation, direction, or under the supervision of a foreign power

in collaboration or with assistance, funding, or agreement from a foreign power.

Our proposed wording would require a clearer link between the person committing the offence and a foreign power.

Clarifying the meaning of providing relevant benefit to a foreign power

Proposed new section 78AAB(5) would define the term “to provide relevant benefit to a foreign power” for the purposes of interpreting section 78AAB. We consider that this definition could be made clearer to more accurately reflect all types of activity that are intended to be regarded as providing relevant benefit to a foreign power.

As introduced, subsection (5)﻿(b) specifies that providing relevant benefit may include enhancing the “political, economic, or military capability or influence” of a foreign power. We recommend amending this to instead read: “political or economic influence or the military or technological capability”. This would ensure that enhancing a foreign power’s technological capability is included in the definition. It would also more clearly distinguish between a foreign power’s influence and capability.

Amendments to other Acts

Clause 16 would make minor and consequential amendments to Acts specified in the Schedule of the bill. As introduced, the Schedule includes amendments to 13 Acts.

Amendments to eight Acts included in the Schedule as introduced would set up an exclusion so a person could still be prosecuted or compelled to give evidence for the offences in new sections 78AAA and 78AAB, even if they have general immunity. This is consistent with existing provisions for other serious offences in the Crimes Act, including espionage. Following the bill’s introduction, it has been identified that several additional Acts need to be amended to make this change, and some other consequential changes. Accordingly, we recommend amending the Schedule to include amendments to the following Acts:

the Children and Young People’s Commission Act 2022

the Commerce Act 1986

the Fair Trading Act 1986

the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011

the Intelligence and Security Act 2017

the Oranga Tamariki Act 2019

the Privacy Act 2020

the Radiocommunications Act 1989

the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 2021

the Takeovers Act 1993.

The Schedule, as introduced, would also amend the Bail Act 2000. Section 9 of the Bail Act provides that a person charged with espionage or treason cannot be granted bail, unless ordered by the Governor-General or a High Court Judge. The bill would amend section 9 to include the offences in new sections 78AA and 78AAA in this provision. This means that a person charged with either of these offences would also have their access to bail restricted.

We consider that the offence in section 78AA (which relates to wrongful communication, retention, or copying of classified information) should not be included in this provision. However, we consider that the new offence in new section 78AAB (which relates to committing an imprisonable offence to benefit a foreign power) should be included. We recommend amending section 9 of the Bail Act, by means of amending the Schedule, to provide for this.

Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand differing view

The Green Party does not support this bill. While it is important to ensure New Zealand is protected from genuine threats of foreign interference, this legislation does not ensure sufficient protections for civil liberties and democratic freedoms. We share the concerns by submitters that this legislation could be used against environmental advocates, trade unions, human rights groups, and indigenous peoples.

We consider that the new offences created represent state overreach and a significant threat to civil liberties, particularly the right to peacefully protest and organise, the right to privacy, and the right to voice one’s own personal political opinions.

References to “foreign power” and what it means to act “for or on behalf of” a foreign power are too broad and have not addressed the concerns of many submitters. Intelligence agencies often highlight concerns about foreign influence from countries such as China and Russia, but there is no clarity on how this bill will address, if at all, the influence of Five Eyes countries and the additional complexities of navigating those relationships. There is also insufficient clarity on how this would address interference from powerful multi-national corporations who might owe no allegiance to any foreign power.

References to benefiting a foreign power are also too subjective and broad. The implications of this are numerous; in particular, the right to peaceful protest could be threatened by accusations of protest movements being in service of a foreign power.

We are also concerned that consultation with Māori was inadequate, particularly given submitters’ concerns about the Crown’s poor track record in this area, and the risk that this legislation could be used to unfairly target Māori, especially those with aspirations for Tino Rangatiratanga and Mana Motuhake.
