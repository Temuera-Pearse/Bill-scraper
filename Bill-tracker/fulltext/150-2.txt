Education and Training (Vocational Education and Training System) Amendment Bill

Government Bill

150—2

As reported from the Education and Workforce Committee

Commentary
Recommendation

The Education and Workforce Committee has examined the Education and Training (Vocational Education and Training System) Amendment Bill and recommends by majority that it be passed. We recommend all amendments unanimously, except for three, in clauses 4, 22 (new section 318(1)), and 23 (new section 370), which are recommended by majority.

Introduction

The bill seeks to reform vocational education and training in New Zealand by amending the Education and Training Act 2020. It would disestablish Te Pūkenga and devolve decision-making to regional entities. It would also disestablish workforce development councils.

The bill proposes changes in the following areas:

Polytechnics—the bill would reestablish regional polytechnics. It would also establish a system of “federation polytechnics” and a Federation Committee. A “federation polytechnic” would be one that the Minister considered needs additional support. Federation polytechnics would have access to shared services through an anchor polytechnic and additional support through the Federation Committee.

Industry skills boards—the bill would enable the establishment of industry skills boards (ISBs) to replace the functions of workforce development councils (WDCs). ISBs would have the new function of strategic workforce analysis and planning.

Work-based training—Currently most work-based training, generally apprenticeships and traineeships, is supported by Te Pūkenga. The bill would allow the provision of this training to move from Te Pūkenga to ISBs during a two-year transition period. The transition period is to allow other providers to develop replacement programmes. The intention is for private providers, polytechnics, and wānanga to manage all aspects of work-based training.

Transition—the bill would provide transitional arrangements for Te Pūkenga and the WDCs. Te Pūkenga would be renamed the New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology (NZIST) until it is disestablished.

Legislative scrutiny

As part of our consideration of the bill, we have examined its consistency with principles of legislative quality. We have no issues regarding the legislation’s design to bring to the attention of the House.

Proposed amendments

This commentary covers the main amendments we recommend to the bill as introduced. We do not discuss minor or technical amendments.

Appointing members of a polytechnic’s council

New section 318, proposed through clause 22, sets out the matters that a polytechnic’s council must consider when appointing members to its council. Subsection (1) includes requirements that the council should reflect the communities in the region, with regard to specified diversity aspects. We consider that this should be amended to be less prescribed and more inclusive, which would better reflect the diverse communities served by polytechnics. We therefore recommend, by majority, amending subsection (1) to state only that “the council of a polytechnic should, as far as is reasonably practicable, reflect the communities in the region that the polytechnic serves.”

We also recommend, by majority, a consequential amendment to remove paragraph (ea) in proposed new section 9(2) (through clause 4(2)), which refers to section 318(1)﻿(b) as introduced.

Amendments related to the federation of polytechnics
Federation Committee not to take actions to the detriment of anchor polytechnics

Clause 22, new section 328, sets out the duties of the Federation Committee. Subsection (1)﻿(b) would set out that the committee must act in the interests of federation polytechnics.

We do not want subsection (1)﻿(b) to disadvantage anchor polytechnics. We recommend amending new section 328(1)﻿(b) so that the committee must act in the interests of federation polytechnics unless doing so would be detrimental to the interests of an anchor polytechnic.

Criteria for anchor polytechnics declining services

New section 337 sets out the role of anchor polytechnics. It would include that an anchor polytechnic must provide services that the Federation Committee considered necessary to give effect to the purposes of the federation. Section 337(2) sets out circumstances when anchor polytechnics could cease to provide services. Submitters commented about a possible risk of anchor polytechnics having to start providing support services when they are not in a good position to do so. We agree that there should be more protection in place: the criteria should apply to the starting of new services in a similar manner as to the continuation of services. We recommend amending new section 337 to enable an anchor polytechnic to decline to provide services if the criteria in 337(2) are met.

Criteria for removing a polytechnic from the federation

Clause 22, new section 339 sets out the process that the Minister would need to follow to designate or remove designation of federation polytechnics. New section 339(3) would specify the criteria that the Minister must consider in designating a federation polytechnic.

However, new section 339(6) does not set out equivalent criteria for a polytechnic to be removed as a federation polytechnic. We consider it should be clear that a polytechnic can be removed once it is operating at a standard that federation support is no longer required. We recommend amending new section 339(6) so that it mirrors the criteria in new section 339(3).

Terms for appointing Federation Committee chairperson

Schedule 2 of the bill would insert new Schedule 11A into the Act. It sets out administrative provisions relating to the new Federation Committee. We recommend amending Schedule 2 to provide greater clarity about the procedure for appointing the Federation Committee’s chairperson. We consider our amendments balance flexibility with certainty about the requirements for appointing the chairperson.

Provision of the Federation Committee’s annual report to federation and anchor polytechnics

New Schedule 11A would specify that the Federation Committee must provide its annual report to federation polytechnics. We agree with submitters that both types of polytechnics should receive the annual report. We recommend new Schedule 11A, clause 13 be amended so that the Federation Committee be required to provide its annual report to both federation and anchor polytechnics.

Industry skills boards
Use of WDC and Te Pūkenga assets during transition

Clause 23, new section 362 proposes the establishment of ISBs. Under new section 362(2)﻿(b)﻿(ii), ISBs could be required to use some assets in certain ways. It would apply to assets such as those of work-based learning divisions in Te Pūkenga during the transition period.

We would like the provision to be clearer that it is designed to support transition. We recommend amending new section 362(2)﻿(b)﻿(ii) to allow an ISB’s use of assets to include assets allocated from a WDC or Te Pūkenga.

Governance arrangements for establishing ISBs

Section 363(3) of the Act provides for governance arrangements for when WDCs are established. Under section 363(3)﻿(a), the Minister must, as far as reasonably practicable, ensure representation of employers and employees in the industries that they provide education in.

We consider it would be prudent to impose an equivalent duty on the Minister regarding governance arrangements for establishing ISBs. We recommend inserting paragraph (aa) into new section 365 to apply a similar provision to ISBs.

We note that this would not necessitate an employer or employee being directly represented on the governing board. The duty could be fulfilled by convening an advisory group as set out in Orders in Council.

Fairness requirements

ISBs would have the role of providing advice to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) about programme funding and endorsement. This has the potential to create conflicts of interest. We consider people who have an ownership interest or governance role in an education provider should not be allowed to serve on an ISB in locations where that provider offers programmes. We recommend amending clause 23, new section 366 so that individuals could not be a member of an ISB that develops or maintains a qualification offered by a provider in which they have an interest.

Additionally, we consider that ISBs should have to operate in a fair manner, for example, by not giving an advantage to one provider over another. We recommend amending new section 369 to require ISBs to treat providers in a fair, equitable, and consistent manner. This would ensure that they operate impartially and enhance their credibility as standard-setting bodies.

Quality assurance functions that ISBs could charge a fee for

Clause 23, new section 373 provides that an ISB could charge fees for its quality assurance functions. We consider the definition of quality assurance functions in new section 373(8) to be too broad. We consider it would allow ISBs to charge fees for functions that may not strictly be quality assurance functions. For example, developing qualifications, micro-credentials, and capstone assessments are not quality assurance activities, but activities conducted for industries. We recommend tightening the definition to refer to an ISB’s activities in relation to administering capstone assessments, endorsing programmes, and moderating assessments.

Consultation requirements on a proposed levy order for ISBs

The Regulations Review Committee wrote to us about the powers in clause 23, new section 385A. The clause proposes that a levy may be imposed on qualifying members by an ISB. Subsection (2)﻿(a) sets out the required consultation before a levy could be imposed—ISBs would need to consult with the group it was intending to place levies on. We consider it would be useful to clarify that the consultation should be on the levy provisions as well as on whether a levy should be implemented or not. We recommend that the consultation be specified to be “on the proposals relating to the levy order”.

Performance of ISBs’ functions and duties

New section 370, proposed through clause 23, sets out the functions and duties that ISBs must perform. Paragraph (e) states that ISBs must act in a manner that contribute to an education system that honours Te Tiriti o Waitangi and supports Māori–Crown relations.

We consider that this paragraph could be amended to better reflect the role of ISBs in the vocational education system, and ensure there is alignment with the Tertiary Education Strategy. We recommend, by majority, that this paragraph is amended to state that ISBs must act in a manner that has regard to the needs of Māori and other population groups as identified in the tertiary education strategy issued under section 7. This wording is consistent with the Education and Training Act.

We also recommend, by majority, a consequential amendment to remove paragraph (eb) from proposed new section 9(2), through clause 4(2), that references the original wording of section 370(e).

Transitional arrangements
Definition of successor organisations

Schedule 1 would insert a new Part 7 into Schedule 1 of the Act. Clause 127 sets out some definitions, including the meaning of “successor organisation”. We note that the definition refers to the minimum activities and functions that a successor organisation would carry out. We recommend that Schedule 1, new clauses 127 and 139 be amended to clarify that successor organisations that partake in other activities would not be precluded from the transitional arrangements.

Transfer of Te Pūkenga’s work-based learning divisions’ reserves and assets

Schedule 1 of the bill sets out the process for transferring rights, assets, liabilities, agreements, and training activities from Te Pūkenga to ISBs. Similarly, it sets out the process that would be followed for the transfer of rights, assets, liabilities, agreements, and training activities from an ISB to a tertiary education provider following the transition period.

Submitters said that the bill does not provide for how Te Pūkenga’s work-based learning divisions would be treated. Work-based learning divisions are the parts of Te Pūkenga that focus on providing work-based training. Each is based on a former industry training organisation that moved its programmes, learners, and assets into Te Pūkenga.

We recognise that work-based training is intended to be a temporary function of ISBs. We propose an amendment to clarify this. We recommend updating the transition plan for training activities required to be developed under clause 131 of Schedule 1 to require that assets received from a work-based learning division be used solely for work-based training activities. We recommend it also clarifies that the assets must be managed in a way that ensures they are available for transfer to a tertiary education provider following the transition period.

Operational matters of the NZIST council

Schedule 1, new clause 128 provides for the continued existence of Te Pūkenga during the transition period and its re-naming to the New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology (NZIST). It also makes clear that Te Pūkenga’s council would continue to exist during the transition period as NZIST’s council.

We would like to ensure this council can continue to operate through the transition period. We recommend amending new clause 128 to specify that NZIST’s council could continue to operate even if its membership falls below the minimum number required by the principal Act. Further, we recommend an amendment to allow existing elected members of the council to continue to serve even if the advisory committee that elected them ceases to operate during the transition period.

Consultation on transferred training agreements

Schedule 1, new clause 143 sets out how existing training agreements would be treated through the transition. Subclause (4) would require a successor organisation to consult the parties to a training agreement and secure their agreement on changes. We heard that this clause could be interpreted as requiring consultation with all affected trainees and employers on any proposed changes to delivery and training. We recommend clarifying the provision by requiring a successor training provider to consult the parties to a training agreement prior to it being amended.

Clarifying ISBs’ ability to provide specific education and training

New clauses 152 to 158 of Schedule 1 would allow ISBs to provide training activities from the commencement of relevant provisions in the bill until 31 December 2027. New clause 153 would enable ISBs to provide training activities through this transition period pending their transfer to a tertiary education provider.

Clause 23 of the bill, new section 372 would prohibit ISBs providing any education or training approved by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA). It would also prohibit ISBs from operating or holding an interest in an organisation that provided education or training approved by NZQA.

There could be circumstances where these two provisions would be in conflict. The bill does indicate when Schedule 1, clause 153 would apply, but we consider it could be clearer. Therefore, we recommend amending clause 153 to clarify that it would override new section 372, and that the additional function would only apply to programmes transferred under a transition plan.

Responsibility for pastoral care during the transition period

Submitters raised concerns about the continuation of pastoral care for students and trainees. We want to ensure that the bill would not change obligations for pastoral care during work-based training. Such obligations are provided for in codes of well-being and safety issued under section 534(1) of the Act. Obligations should remain the same while training programmes are under the stewardship of ISBs during the transition period. To make this clear, we recommend adding new clause 153A to Schedule 1 to reflect that ISBs are responsible for pastoral care of work-based learners and that a code of well-being and safety issued under section 534(1) applies to ISBs that provide training activities in accordance with clause 153.

ISBs to adopt the same fees Te Pūkenga is charging at the start of the transition period

Schedule 1, clause 154 would allow ISBs to charge fees for training activities. This clause does not recognise the fees that Te Pūkenga currently charges for training activities. Under the Act, Te Pūkenga is required to limit fees to actual and reasonable costs.

The effect of clause 154 would be to require ISBs to develop new fees schedules to apply during the transition period—up to two years. We were advised that developing new fees schedules would likely be complex and disruptive for learners and employees. Additionally, it could have negative financial effects on ISBs. We recommend amending clause 154 so that ISBs could charge no more than the fees charged by Te Pūkenga as at the intended transition start date (31 December 2025).

ISBs could enrol trainees unless the TEC determines otherwise

Schedule 1, clause 155 provides for ISB enrolment of trainees. It states that an ISB could not enrol a new trainee in a training activity unless the Tertiary Education Commission approves the enrolment. We do not want the clause to have the effect of removing learner and employer choice. To make this clear, we recommend that clause 155 be reframed so that the TEC could stop enrolments rather than being required to approve them.

Transition plan timeframe

Clause 156 of Schedule 1 would require a transition plan to be in place to transfer training activities from ISBs to tertiary education providers. Clause 157 specifies the timeframe for training activities to be transferred. We consider it would be useful to make it clear that these two clauses are linked, in other words, that the transition plan set out in clause 156 should be referenced in clause 157. We recommend amending clause 157 accordingly.

Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand and New Zealand Labour Party differing view

The Green Party and the Labour Party do not support the Education and Training (Vocational Education and Training System) Amendment Bill. We agree with the majority of submitters who expressed opposition to the bill. We disagree with the bill for a myriad of different reasons but for the sake of brevity we will concentrate our submission on a few key points.

Disruption to the vocational education and training sector

The Education and Training (Vocational Education and Training System) Amendment Bill is a key enabler of the wider Government agenda of dismantling Te Pūkenga, with the ones that are “financially viable” becoming independent, stand-alone entities and the ones that are not being merged into a federation structure anchored around Open Polytechnic. It is important to remember that Te Pūkenga had only been in place for a short time, yet many submitters noted that despite this it had already shown positive results: stability, resource sharing, and funding balance to support struggling polytechnics.

We heard from submitters—particularly the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and the Tertiary Institute of Allied Staff (TIASA) that the Government’s current reforms to disestablish Te Pūkenga were more disruptive than previous governments’ reforms that merged the polytechnics into Te Pūkenga.

The shift from Workforce Development Councils to Industry and Skills Boards will also create further disruption which will create distraction, disruption, and barriers to the critical role of work-based learning and industry engagement.

The implementation of these reforms means that staff and students have had to endure nearly a decade of disruption. We acknowledge the disappointment industry feels that the reforms did not meet their expectations. We know from submissions that WDCs had been working well, and many felt that their disestablishment was premature.

Will not enhance sector viability

There is no evidence that this bill will enhance the viability of the vocational education and training sector. Government has received advice that the impact of the reform would leave the newly independent polytechs in a “similar, if not worse” financial position than they were prior to being merged into Te Pūkenga.

The fact that the Minister still has not released the full business case and financials of the transition is concerning. It is her responsibility to the sector to show evidence that these transitions will be worth the upheaval that staff and students are facing.

We know these changes do nothing to address underlying issues in the vocational sector. A high proportion of submitters noted that Minister Simmonds’ changes only move the furniture, while neglecting the chronic underfunding issues the sector faces.

Decreases student and staff representation

The bill establishes independent polytechnic governing councils with no guarantee for staff or student representation. We believe that—similarly to the university councils that govern universities—polytechnic councils should also have provisions for guaranteed staff and student representation.

Deprioritises Māori representation

We agree with the submission of the Tertiary Education Union and others that the qualifier “as far as reasonably practicable” in section 318 of the bill could potentially limit the scope of Māori representation. It is essential that the Crown honours Te Tiriti by removing this clause and guaranteeing Māori representation for polytechnic councils. Submitters were strongly in favour of the inclusion of Te Tiriti provisions in the legislation to ensure that there would be appropriate representation for Māori, as well as Pasifika and ethnic communities.

We cannot ignore the concerns raised by the Mātauranga Iwi Leaders Group that the drafting process did not engage effectively with Māori. These reforms cannot be allowed to water down the work that was done during Te Pūkenga to ensure Māori had a meaningful voice at the decision-making table.
