Auckland Council (Auckland Future Fund) Bill

Local Bill

118—1

Explanatory note
General policy statement

The governing body of the Auckland Council (the governing body) has established the Auckland Future Fund (the AFF) as part of the Auckland Council’s Long-term Plan 2024–2034.

The governing body has resolved to promote a local Bill with the purpose of ensuring that the AFF is a long-term financial investment for the benefit of the current and future communities of the Auckland region.

The Bill aims to foster public confidence in the administration of the AFF, while enabling the Auckland Council to retain the flexibility to make decisions about the entity or body that holds and manages the AFF and the nature and structure of the AFF. The Bill does this by—

safeguarding in statute the key principles for governing and managing the AFF and for distributing funds from the AFF; and

ensuring that decisions about investment of the AFF are made on a prudent and commercial basis.

On 16 May 2024, the governing body resolved—

that the purposes of the AFF will be—

to protect the real value of the Auckland Council’s intergenerational assets so that they can continue to benefit future generations; and

to provide an enhanced return to the Auckland Council to fund services and infrastructure:

that the AFF will be established as a trust with strict protections requiring its assets to be managed and applied with the intent of maintaining or increasing the real value of its capital over the medium term:

to initially capitalise the AFF with the Auckland Council’s shareholding in Auckland International Airport Limited, with an amendment to the Auckland Council’s Auckland Airport Shareholding Policy to enable the sale of those shares to achieve the purposes of the AFF:

that the AFF may be further capitalised with other assets or funds in the future.

The Auckland Council may make a resolution under clause 11 only if the proposed distribution is explicitly provided for in its long-term plan and was properly consulted on.

Clause 12 provides that the Auckland Council and entities approved by the Council may receive distributions from the AFF.
