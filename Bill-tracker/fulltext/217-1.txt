Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu Claims Settlement Bill

Government Bill

217—1

Explanatory note
General policy statement

Legislation is required to give effect to some elements of the Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu deed of settlement (the deed), which was signed on 26 September 2025 by Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu and the Crown. This Bill records the acknowledgements and apology made to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu by the Crown when the deed was signed and gives effect to redress in the deed that requires legislation.

Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu

Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu trace their origins to Te Ruinga, the son of Tumutumu from Ngāti Raukawa. Their area of interest includes Te Aroha, the Kaimai Range to Katikati and Te Puna, the Hauraki Plains, and the Coromandel Peninsula. The 2023 census estimated Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu had 510 members.

Negotiations

In June 2009, the Crown proposed a regional approach for Treaty settlements to iwi and hapū with interests in the Hauraki region. The 12 iwi of Hauraki, including Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, formed the Pare Hauraki Collective for the purpose of negotiating collective redress for shared interests in the Hauraki region.

In June 2011, the Crown recognised the mandate of the Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu negotiators to negotiate the settlement of historical Treaty of Waitangi claims on behalf of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu through both collective and iwi-specific negotiations.

In July 2017, the deed was initialled. Ratification of the iwi-specific deed occurred in August 2025. The signing of the deed was delayed until September 2025 to allow for resolution of final overlapping interests matters. This Bill gives effect to the iwi-specific redress that requires legislation and settles the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

On 26 September 2025, Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu signed the Pare Hauraki Collective Redress Deed and will receive redress through the collective deed, which also has associated collective legislation.

Key elements of Rāhiri Tumutumu settlement

The settlement contains acknowledgement of Crown breaches of te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles, including the confiscation of land by the Crown, the impact and operations of native land laws, and Crown land acquisitions that left Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu virtually landless.

The settlement includes an apology from the Crown to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu for promoting laws and policies that led to loss of land, damaged the sacred taonga Te Aroha maunga, and undermined their well-being and ability to pass on mātauranga Māori to their mokopuna.

Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu will receive redress that includes 18 sites of cultural significance and financial and commercial redress valued at $5.5 million, along with a wide range of other commercial, cultural, and relationship redress.

Departmental disclosure statement

The Office of Treaty Settlements and Takutai Moana—Te Tari Whakatau is required to prepare a disclosure statement to assist with the scrutiny of this Bill. The disclosure statement provides access to information about the policy development of the Bill and identifies any significant or unusual legislative features of the Bill.

8
Summary of historical account

(1)

Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu tradition records that before Europeans came to Te Aroha, Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu lived on the lands on and surrounding Te Aroha.

(2)

In 1863, the Crown initiated war with Māori in the Waikato when its armed forces crossed the Mangatāwhiri Stream. Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu sent men to fight Crown forces in Waikato. The Crown regarded Māori who fought against it as rebels and as punishment confiscated 290,000 acres of land in the Tauranga district between 1865 and 1868. This included lands in which Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu had interests. It subsequently returned 240,000 acres to Māori in individualised title.

(3)

In 1864, the Crown purchased the Katikati and Te Puna blocks. Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu had interests in some of those lands and received payment of £500. The 1866 deed for the blocks provided for reserves containing wāhi tapu and urupā but there is no evidence that those reserves were made. After the Crown acquired the Katikati and Te Puna blocks, Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu retained no lands in Tauranga Moana.

(4)

In 1871, the Native Land Court overturned an earlier decision and awarded the Aroha block to Hauraki iwi including Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu. Between 1872 and 1877, the Crown purchased much of the Aroha block from other iwi. Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu objected to other iwi receiving payment for land they considered to be theirs. In 1878, following an investigation by the Native Land Court, the entire block was awarded to the Crown, subject to the provision of reserves for Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(5)

The Crown retained the hot springs near Te Aroha when the Omahu Reserve was granted to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu in 1878. According to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu traditions, the land was gifted to the Crown by the iwi, who would have ongoing rights to use the springs. By the early twentieth century, however, Māori no longer had free access to the springs or input into the management of this tapu site.

(6)

In 1880, the Crown negotiated a lease with Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu to open a goldfield on the Omahu Reserve. As part of that agreement, the Crown promised to build a township at Te Aroha with a reserve for Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu. In 1882, streets within the township on Māori reserved land were declared public roads. Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu received no compensation for this.

(7)

Between 1884 and 1894, the Crown, local authorities, and private buyers progressively acquired Māori interests in Te Aroha. By the 1920s, the Crown had purchased almost all of the reserve land awarded to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu. In the early twentieth century the Crown used special legislation to acquire further land in Te Aroha.

(8)

Crown developments in the Te Aroha area continued in the 1960s. They included the construction of a road to the summit of Te Aroha and the granting of a mining licence to a private company. The mine site became severely polluted and the damage to this tapu land has caused ongoing distress to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(9)

By the end of the twentieth century, less than 3% of the land in the Aroha block remained in Māori ownership. Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu’s resulting marginalisation, including the loss of te reo Māori, sickness, and socio-economic deprivation, caused much suffering for the iwi. With limited opportunities in their rohe, many Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu moved to cities. This undermined the ability of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu to sustain their culture and identity and to pass mātauranga Māori on to their mokopuna.

He whakarāpopototanga o ngā kōrero tuku iho e pā ana ki ngā kerēme a ngāti rāhiri tumutumu

(1)

E kī ana ngā tutuku a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, i mua atu i te taenga mai o te Pākehā ki Te Aroha, i te noho a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki ngā whenua o runga o Te Aroha, me ngā whenua i ōna taha.

(2)

I te marama o Hūrae 1863 ka huakina e te Karauna tana pakanga ki te iwi Māori o Waikato, i te whakawhitinga o ana ope hōia i te awa o Mangatāwhiri. Ka tukua e Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu he tangata ki te whawhai ki ngā hōia o te Karauna i Waikato. E ai ki te Karauna ko ngāi Māori i whawhai ki a ia he iwi tutū, ā, hei whakawhiu i aua hapū ka murua e ia 290,000 eka o ngā whenua i te rohe o Tauranga i waenga i ngā tau 1865 me 1868. Kei roto i ēnei whenua ētahi i whai pānga ai a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki roto. Nō muri mai ka whakahokia e ia ētahi 240,000 eka ki te Māori hei whenua taitara takitahi.

(3)

I te tau 1864 i hokona e te Karauna ngā poraka o Katikati me Te Puna. I whai pānga anō a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki ētahi o ēnei whenua, ā, i whiwhi ia i te utu £500. I raro i te tīti o 1866 mō aua poraka, tōna tikanga kia wehea he rāhui mō ngā wāhi tapu me ngā urupā, engari kāore he tohu i muri i tērā kua hangaia aua rāhui. I muri i te hoko a te Karaunga i ngā poraka o Te Puna-Katikati, kāore kau he whenua i toe mai mō Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i te rohe o Tauranga Moana.

(4)

I te tau 1871 ka huripokina e te Kōti Whakawā Whenua Māori tētahi whakatau o mua, ā, ka whakawhiwhia te poraka o Aroha ki ngā iwi o Hauraki, tae atu ki a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu. I waenga i ngā tau 1872 me 1877 i hokona e te Karauna te nuinga o te poraka o Aroha i ētahi atu iwi. I whakahē anō a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki te whiwhinga o ētahi atu iwi i te utu mō te whenua i mea rā rātou nō rātou kē anō. I te tau 1878 ka whakawhiwhia e te Kōti Whakawā Whenua Māori te katoa o te poraka ki te Karauna, mēnā ka whakatūria he rāhui motuhake mō Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(5)

I puritia ngā puia i te takiwā o te Aroha e te Karauna, i te karātitanga o te Rāhui o Omahu ki a Ngāti Rāhiri i te tau 1878. E ai ki ngā kōrero tuku iho a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i takohatia aua whenua ki te Karauna e te iwi, me te kī, ka noho tonu ngā mōtika katoa ki te iwi kia whakamahi ia i aua puia. Engari nō te taenga ki ngā tau tuatahi o te rau tau rua tekau kāore i tino whakawāteatia ngā puia kia kore-utu mā ngāi Māori, ā, kāore ō rātou mana whakahaere i tēnei wāhi tapu.

(6)

I te tau 1880 ka tau tētahi kirimana i waenga i te Karauna me Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu hei huaki i tētahi keringa kōura ki te Rāhui o Omahu. Hei wāhanga o tēnei kirimana, i takoto te kī taurangi a te Karauna ka hangaia e ia tētahi tāone i Te Aroha, me tētahi rāhui mō Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu. I te tau 1882 ka whakapuakina e te Karauna ko ngā tiriti katoa i roto i te tāone i runga i ngā whenua rāhui Māori, he rori tūmatanui. Kāore kē a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i whiwhi kāpiheihana mō tēnei whakapuaki.

(7)

I waenga i ngā tau 1884 me 1894 kua oti te hoko haere ngā pānga whenua Māori maha i Te Aroha e te Karauna, e ngā mana ā-takiwā me ngā kaihoko tūmataiti. Nō te taenga ki te ngahuru tau 1920 kua oti te nuinga o ngā whenua rāhui i whakawhiwhia ki a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu te hoko e te Karauna. I ngā tau tuatahi o te rau tau rua tekau ka whakaurua e te Karauna ētahi ture motuhake hei whakawhānui i tāna tango i ētahi atu pānga i te tāone o Te Aroha.

(8)

I haere tonu ngā whanaketanga a te Karauna i te rohe o Te Aroha i te ngahuru tau 1960. Hei wāhi o aua mahi, ka hangaia he rori ki te tihi o te Aroha, ā, ka tukua hoki he raihana keringa ki tētahi kamupene tūmataiti. I noho ko ngā tūkinotanga a te keringa kōura me te rarunga o ēnei whenua tapu hei mamaetanga tino nui mā Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(9)

Ka tae nei ki te mutunga o te rau tau rua tekau, he iti iho i te toru ōrau o ngā whenua o te poraka o Aroha i te noho tonu ki ngā ringaringa o te iwi Māori. Nā ngā hekenga o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i aua tau, tae atu ki te ngaromanga o te reo Māori, te kore e kake ki ngā taumata i ngā kura, te māuiui, me te rarunga i te taha oranga, i taumaha ai, i tino mamae ai te iwi. Nā te iti o ngā whāinga wāhi i tō rātou rohe, ka wehe atu te tini o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki te kimi mahi i roto i ngā tāone. Nā konei i uaua ai te mahi a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki te hapāi i āna tikanga me ōna āhuatanga, tae atu ki tōna kaha ki te tuku atu i te mātauranga Māori ki ā rātou mokopuna.

Acknowledgements

(1)

The Crown acknowledges that Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu has well-founded and legitimate grievances, and that until now it has failed to address those in an appropriate manner. The Crown’s provision of redress to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu for those historical grievances is long overdue.

(2)

The Crown acknowledges that the Tauranga raupatu and the subsequent Tauranga District Lands Acts 1867 and 1868 compulsorily extinguished all customary interests within the confiscation district, including those of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, and this was unjust and breached te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

(3)

The Crown acknowledges that—

(a)

it failed to actively protect Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu interests in lands they wished to retain when it initiated the purchase of Te Puna and Katikati blocks in 1864 without investigating the rights of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu; and

(b)

it also failed to actively protect Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu interests in land they wished to retain when it did not carry out its agreement in the 1866 Te Puna Katikati deed to set aside reserves, including certain wāhi tapu sites, and left Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu alienated from their ancestral lands in Tauranga; and

(c)

these actions breached te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

(4)

The Crown acknowledges that—

(a)

it introduced the native land laws without consulting Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu and the individualisation of title imposed on Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu lands, including sacred sites such as Te Aroha, was inconsistent with tikanga Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu; and

(b)

Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu whānau and hapū had no choice but to participate in the Native Land Court system to protect their interests in their lands and to integrate land into the modern economy; and

(c)

the operation and impact of the native land laws, in particular the awarding of land to individual Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu rather than to their iwi or hapū, made those lands more susceptible to partition, fragmentation, and alienation; and

(d)

this contributed to the further erosion of the traditional tribal structures of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, which were based on collective tribal and hapū custodianship of land, and the Crown failed to take adequate steps to protect those structures and this was a breach of te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

(5)

The Crown acknowledges that it deprived some Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu individuals of control of their land without their consent when it proclaimed a goldfield in Te Aroha, and that this failure to respect their legal rights was a breach of te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

(6)

The Crown acknowledges that valuable mineral resources on lands leased and sold by Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu provided economic benefits to the nation.

(7)

The Crown acknowledges that—

(a)

it continued to control lands in Hauraki owned by Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, which were leased to settlers through residence site licences for many years after the decline of the gold mining industry in the region; and

(b)

it failed for many decades to regularly revise rents for residence site licence lands, and that Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu received rents well below market value for the lease of their lands as a consequence of this failure; and

(c)

it promoted legislation that converted residence site licences to leases in perpetuity, leaving Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu no alternative but to sell their lands to the Crown; and

(d)

these actions deprived Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu of their rangatiratanga over land subject to residence site licences and breached te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

(8)

The Crown acknowledges that once it acquired Te Aroha springs it did not make provision for Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu’s relationship with this tapu site, and this lack of recognition is a long-standing grievance for Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(9)

The Crown acknowledges that Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu were rendered virtually landless due to the cumulative effect of Crown actions and omissions, including—

(a)

the purchasing of the Omahu, Wairakau, and Manawaru reserve blocks, which had been established to ensure that Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu retained sufficient land for their future needs; and

(b)

the taking of lands under public works legislation that were of particular significance to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu; and

(c)

the promotion of legislation, in 1911, to override Ema Lipsey’s will, which enabled the sale of land to the Crown that she had intended to remain with Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(10)

The Crown further acknowledges that its failure to ensure that Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu retained sufficient lands for its present and future needs was a breach of te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles.

(11)

The Crown acknowledges that environmental changes and pollution since the nineteenth century have been a source of distress and grievance for Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu. In particular, the Crown acknowledges that—

(a)

gold mining on Te Aroha from 1880 caused pollution, and this has caused harm to the well-being of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu; and

(b)

further mining for copper, zinc, and lead on Te Aroha maunga from 1966 to 1973 caused substantial environmental damage, and has left the Tui mine site as one of the most polluted sites in Aotearoa New Zealand; and

(c)

the damage done to Te Aroha maunga is an ongoing and deeply felt grievance for Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(12)

The Crown acknowledges that public works takings have impeded the ability of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu to maintain and foster spiritual connections with their ancestral lands.

(13)

The Crown acknowledges that through the alienation of most of their land Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu have lost control over many of their significant sites and resources. This has had an ongoing impact on the ability of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu to maintain spiritual connections to their ancestral lands, undermined their economic base, and eroded their capacity to fulfil their kaitiaki responsibilities.

(14)

The Crown acknowledges the harm endured by many Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu tamariki from decades of Crown policies that strongly discouraged the use of te reo Māori in schools. The Crown also acknowledges the detrimental effects this had on Māori language proficiency and fluency and the impact on the intergenerational transmission of te reo Māori and knowledge of mātauranga Māori practices.

(15)

The Crown acknowledges that the health of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu has been worse than that of many other New Zealanders, and they have not had the same opportunities in life that many other New Zealanders have enjoyed.

(16)

The Crown recognises that through its actions and omissions it has contributed to the economic and spiritual hardship and marginalisation of Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu in their rohe.

Ngā Whakaaetanga

(1)

Kei te whakaaae te Karauna ki ngā nawe whai take, whai tikanga hoki, o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, waihoki, tae mai ki nāianei kāore anō kia whakatikaina ō mua hē, kia ea i runga i te tika. Kua roa rawa te iwi e tatari ana ki te whakaeanga i ngā hara a te Karauna o mua, mō ngā nawe tuku iho o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(2)

Kei te whakaae te Kārauna ko ēnei mahi, arā, te raupatu i Tauranga me ngā Ture o muri mai, arā, ngā Ture e kīa nei te Tauranga District Lands Acts 1867 me 1868, i murua katoatia ai ngā pānga tuku iho i te rohe muru raupatu, tae atu ki ērā o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki ō rātou whenua, ā, i tino hē tēnei mahi, he takahanga hoki i te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.

(3)

(b)

(c)

ko ēnei mahi hei takahanga i te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.

(4)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna—

(a)

ka whakaurua e ia ētahi ture whenua Māori, kāore i kōrero ki a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i te tuatahi, ā, ko te taitara takitahi i ngā whenua o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, tae atu ki ngā wāhi tapu pēnei me Te Aroha, i taupatupatu ki ngā tikanga a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu;

(b)

kāore he putanga mō ngā whānau me ngā hapū o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, i tua atu i te whakauru atu ki ngā whakaritenga o te Kōti Whenua Māori, hei kaupare i ō rātou pānga, hei urutomo hoki ki te ōhanga o te ao hōu;

(c)

ko te hāpainga me te pānga o ngā ture whenua Māori, otirā, te whakawhiwhinga taitara takitahi te mea matua, ki ngā tāngata takitahi o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, hāunga ia te iwi me te hapū, te take i wāhia ai, i marara ai, i ngaro rawa ai aua whenua; ā

(d)

nā konei i horohoro ai ngā kaupapa whakahaere o te iwi o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, i takea mai hoki ōna tikanga tuku iho i te pupuru ā-iwi, ā-hapū hoki i te whenua, ā kīhai te Karauna i anga mai ki te tiaki i aua ritenga, i aua kaupapa hoki, ā, he takahanga anō tēnei o Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.

(5)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna i raruraru ētahi o ngā tāngata takitahi o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i te rironga atu o ō rātou whenua, kāore hoki aua tāngata i whakaae i te tuatahi, i te whakapuakitanga a te Karauna i te keringa kōura i Te Aroha, ā, ka noho tāna kore e hāpai i ō rātou mōtika ā-ture hei takanga anō o te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.

(6)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna nā ngā rawa matū i ngā whenua i rīhitia, i hokona rānei e Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i hua ake ai he painga ā-ōhanga mō te motu katoa.

(7)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna—

(a)

i whakahaere tonu ia i ngā whenua o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i Hauraki i rīhitia ki ngā manene nā runga i ngā raihana whenua kāinga noho mō ngā tau tini i muri mai i te hekenga o ngā mahi keri kōura i te rohe;

(b)

i ngoikore ia i tāna korenga e hoki mai ki te whakahōu i ngā rēti, mō ngā ngahuru tau tini, mō ngā raihana whenua kāinga noho, ā, i whiwhi a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i ngā rēti i raro rawa i tō te ao hokohoko whānui mō ngā rīhi whenua, nā tēnei ngoikorenga te take;

(c)

i whakaurua mai e ia he ture hei huri i ngā raihana whenua kāinga noho hei rīhi mutunga kore, ā, nā konei kāore he huarahi kē atu i wātea ki a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i te hokonga o ō rātou whenua e te Karauna; ā

(d)

ko ēnei mahi i tango i te rangatiranga o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki ō rātou whenua i raro i aua raihana whenua kāinga noho, ā, he takahanga anō tēnei i te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.

(8)

Kei te whakaae te Kārauna, i muri i tāna hoko i ngā puia i Te Aroha kāore i whakaritea he tikanga hei tiaki i te pānga tuku iho o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki tēnei wāhi tapu, ā, ko tēnei korenga e whakaae ki aua here tētahi nawe nui mā Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i ngā whakatupuranga maha.

(9)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna nā ēnei mahi kua tata whenua kore tonu a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, nā ngā mahi hē pūputu a te Karauna, tae atu ki āna korenga e mahi i ngā mahi e tika ana, tae atu ki:

(a)

tāna hoko i ngā poraka rāhui o Omahu, o Wairākau, me Manawaru, i whakatūria rā kia nui anō ngā whenua mō ō rātou hiahia ā raurangi;

(b)

tāna tangohanga i ētahi whenua i raro i ngā ture mahi tūmatanui, i noho hei whenua rangatira mō Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu; ā

(c)

te hāpainga o tētahi ture i te tau 1911, hei pēhi atu i ngā whakapuaki o te wira a Ema Lipsey, i āhei ai ōna whenua i hiahia rā ia kia noho tūturu ki a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu te hoko rawa.

(10)

Nā ngā mahi hē a te Karuana, arā, tāna kore e whakarite tikanga e mau ai tētahi rahinga whenua tōtika mō Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu o aua wā, mō raurangi hoki, he tika tēnei kia kīa he takahanga o Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi me ōna mātāpono.

(11)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna ko ngā huringa i te taiao me ngā takakinotanga i ngā whenua me ngā wai, mai i te rau tau tekau mā iwa tētahi take pouritanga nui, tētahi nawe nui hoki mō Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu. Otirā kei te whakaae te Karauna:

(a)

nā ngā mahi keri kōura i Te Aroha mai i 1880 ka takakinotia te whenua, ā, ka whara te hauora o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i tēnei mahi;

(b)

nā ētahi atu mahi keri konukura, konutea me te konumatā i Te Aroha maunga mai i 1966 ki 1973 ka tino tūkinotia te taiao, ā, kua noho te keringa kōura Tūī hei wāhi tino kino rawa atu te takakinotanga i Aotearoa New Zealand; ā

(c)

ko te takakinotanga i Te Aroha maunga tētahi nawe mauroa, take whakamamae hoki mō Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu.

(12)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna nā ngā tangohanga mō ngā mahi tūmatanui i uaua ai te mahi a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki te whakamahana, ki te whakapipiri hoki ki ngā herenga tuku iho i ō rātou whenua.

(13)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna nā te rironga atu o te nuinga o ō rātou whenua kua riro atu hoki te mana whakahaere mā Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i te nuinga o ō rātou wāhi tapu me ō rātou rawa. Kua tino pā hoki tēnei ki te kaha o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki te whakapipiri atu ki ō rātou whenua tuku iho, kua turakina hoki tōna puna ora, tōna puna kai hoki, ā, kua whakapōrarurarutia āna mahi kaitiaki i tōna rohe anō.

(14)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna ki ngā mahi tūkino i pā ki ngā tamariki o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, i kore ai e whakaaetia e ngā kaupapa here o te Karauna kia kōrero Māori i roto i ngā kura. Kei te whakaae hoki te Karauna ki ngā pānga kino o aua kaupapa here ki te mōhiotanga me te matatau ki te reo, me te pānga o ēnei āhuatanga ki te tukunga ā-reanga o te reo Māori, me te mātauranga Māori.

(15)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna kua hē kē atu te hauora o Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i tō te nuinga o ngā tāngata o Aotearoa, ā, kāore i ōrite ngā huarahi i wātea ki ōna uri ki ō te nuinga o ngā tāngata o Aotearoa.

(16)

Kei te whakaae te Karauna nā āna mahi, hapanga hoki i taumaha kē atu ai ngā raruraru ā-ōhanga, ā-wairua mā te iwi, ā, i parea ai hoki a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu ki tahaki i tōna āke rohe.

Apology

Crown apology

The text of the apology offered by the Crown to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, as set out in the deed of settlement, is as follows:

“(a)

The Crown’s acts and omissions, in the history of its relationship with Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, have led to warfare, confiscation, and the loss of the lands which had sustained you for generations.

(b)

In promoting laws and policies which led to the alienation of your whenua and irreversible damage to your sacred taonga Te Aroha maunga, the Crown has caused significant and lasting harm to Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu. The Crown’s acts and omissions have caused you great social, cultural, and economic hardship, and severely undermined your ability to foster mātauranga Māori and te reo Māori, and to maintain your kaitiaki responsibilities in your rohe. For its actions which harmed Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, and for its breaches of te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles, the Crown unreservedly apologises.

(c)

The Crown seeks to atone for these injustices and begin a process of healing. Let this settlement mark a new phase in the Crown’s relationship with Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu based on trust and mutual respect, and in keeping with the principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi.”

He Whakapāha

Tēnei te Karauna te tuku whakapāha atu nei ki a koutou, Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, ki ō koutou tūpuna, mokopuna anō hoki:

“(a)

Nā ngā mahi a te Karauna, otirā nā āna korenga e mahi i ngā mahi e tika ana, i roto i tōna mōhiotanga ki a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu i roto i ngā whakatupuranga, i ara ake ai te pakanga, te muru raupatu me te ngaromanga atu o ngā whenua i noho hei wai-ū mā koutou mō ngā whakatuputanga maha.

(b)

I tāna mahi ki te whakatairanga ture, kaupapa here hoki i ngaro rawa ai ō whenua, me ngā tūkinotanga rongoā-kore i tō koutou taonga tapu, i Te Aroha maunga, kua tino whara, kua raruraru mō ngā tau tini noa iho a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, arā, i ngā mahi a te Karauna. Nā ngā mahi me ngā hapanga a te Karauna i tino whara koutou, i te taha pāpori, i te taha tikanga, i te taha ōhanga, i tino uaua ai tā koutou tukutuku i te mātauranga Māori me te reo Māori, waihoki tō koutou kaha ki te kawe i ngā tikanga kaitiaki i tōu rohe. Mō ēnei mahi, i whara ai a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, me āna takahanga i te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi me ōna mātāpono, ka tino whakapāha atu te Karauna.

(c)

E rapu tikanga ana te Karauna ki te whakaea i ēnei hara, ki te whakamahu hoki i ngā nawe. Ko te hiahia kia tīmata i tēnei rā tētahi hononga hou mā te Karauna ki a Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu, kia noho ko te whakawhirinaki me te pono hei kaupapa matua, i runga anō i ngā mātāpono o te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi.”

Amounts payable in respect of vested minerals
124
Purpose and scope of arrangement for payments

(1)

The purpose of sections 125 to 129 is to provide that the rights to vested minerals include the payment by the Crown, in relation to the vested minerals, of—

(a)

the representative amount; or

(b)

if section 129(2) applies, the actual amount.

(2)

Payments made under subsection (1) must be made to the trustees.

(3)

The representative amount or the actual amount payable is based on the amount of royalties paid to the Crown in the preceding year or years for which an application is made under section 130 in respect of the vested minerals.

(4)

Payment of the representative amount or the actual amount, as appropriate, discharges the obligations of the Crown under this subpart in respect of any royalties paid to the Crown in respect of the vested minerals.

125
Obligation to pay representative or actual amount

(1)

The chief executive, on receiving an application under section 130, must pay the representative amount or the actual amount, as appropriate, in respect of vested minerals to the trustees.

(2)

Subsection (1) applies even if the trustees have sold all or any of the relevant land or vested minerals, and the chief executive is not required to transfer payments to, or otherwise deal with, any new owner of the vested minerals.

(3)

The requirement to pay the representative amount or the actual amount applies—

(a)

only if the Crown has been paid royalties in respect of the vested minerals in the year or years preceding the year in which an application is made under section 130; and

(b)

only in respect of a period of not more than 8 years after the date on which those royalties were received by the Crown.

(4)

This section is subject to section 128 (shared ownership of land), section 130 (application for payment of representative amount), and section 132 (other conditions applying to payments).

Calculation of amount payable
126
Calculation of representative amount

The representative amount payable under section 125 is calculated using the following formula:

$r × (a ÷ pa)

where—

a

is the area of relevant land within or overlapping the permit area

pa

is the total permit area of a privilege that is within or overlaps the relevant land

$r

is the total amount of royalties paid to the Crown in respect of the vested minerals, for the years applied for under section 130, in respect of a privilege whose permit area is within or overlaps the relevant land.

Example

If—

a is 4 sq kms; and

pa is 20 sq kms; and

$r is $1,500; then

$1,500 × (4 ÷ 20) = $300.

127
Calculation of representative amount if more than 1 permit area

If more than 1 permit area is within or overlaps the relevant land,—

(a)

the representative amounts must be separately calculated for each permit area in accordance with section 126; and

(b)

the total representative amount payable to the trustees in respect of the vested minerals for the permit areas is the sum of the separate amounts calculated under paragraph (a).

128
Calculation of representative amount if relevant land held in shares

If the relevant land is held in shares, the representative amount payable to the trustees in respect of the vested minerals is calculated using the following formula:

$r × (a ÷ pa) × %

where—

a, pa, and $r

have the meanings given to those terms in section 126

%

is the percentage of the vested minerals owned in each share at the time the relevant land is vested in or transferred to the trustees.

Example

If—

a is 4 sq kms; and

pa is 20 sq kms; and

$r is $1,500; and

the vested minerals are owned in 20% shares; then

$1,500 × (4 ÷ 20) × 20% = $60.

129
When actual amount may be paid

(1)

When an application is received under section 130, the Minister must determine whether the information is sufficient to identify the actual amount paid to the Crown as royalties in respect of vested minerals in the year or years applied for.

(2)

If the Minister is satisfied that there is sufficient information to determine the actual amount referred to in subsection (1), the Minister must pay to the trustees the actual amount to which the application relates in respect of those vested minerals instead of the representative amount that would otherwise be payable.

(3)

If there is not sufficient information to enable the Minister to make a determination under subsection (1), the chief executive must determine the representative amount payable in accordance with this subpart.

(4)

If the relevant land is owned in shares, any payment of the actual amount in respect of the vested minerals must be made in the same proportion as the proportion of the shares held in the relevant land at the time the land is vested in or transferred to the trustees.

Application for payment of representative amount
130
Application requirements

(1)

The trustees (but no other person or body) may apply for payment of the representative amount.

(c)

the shares (if any) in which the land is held; and

(d)

(e)

the details of the trustees for the purpose of enabling payment to be made.

(5)

No payment may be made unless an application is made under this section.

(6)

The chief executive may request further information from the trustees—

(a)

to establish the information required under subsection (4):

(b)

to enable the Minister to determine whether the actual amount or the representative amount is to be paid.

131
Advice to be given to trustees

(a)

consider the application, including whether the information is sufficient to enable the Minister to determine the actual amount under section 129; and

(b)

advise the trustees in writing of the amount that the trustees are to be paid.

132
Other conditions applying to payments

(1)

Payment of the representative amount or actual amount, as the case requires,—

(a)

must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable after 31 March in each year; but

(b)

must not be made more than once a year.

(2)

For the first year of payment of the representative amount or actual amount, the payment must be calculated—

(a)

from the date on which the vested minerals in the relevant land became the property of the trustees (the vesting date); and

(b)

in proportion to the number of days that have elapsed in that year on and from the vesting date.

(3)
